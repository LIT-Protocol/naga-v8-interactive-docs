        <h2 style={pageStyles.h2}>Introduction</h2>
        <p style={pageStyles.p}>
          Lit Actions are powerful JavaScript functions that can be used to
          program signing and encryption/decryption operations on the Lit
          network. Lit Actions are stateless, immutable, confidential, and are
          executed within the secure trusted execution environment (TEE) present
          within each Lit node.
        </p>
        <p style={pageStyles.p}>
          What sets Lit Actions apart is their ability to natively "talk" to
          both on and off-chain data sources, including smart contracts, price
          feeds, social networks, and other external APIs. Highly versatile, Lit
          Actions can be used to implement virtually any logic/workflow that can
          be written in JavaScript.
